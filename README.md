# inf01151_pg-1

## TODO
- understand how ```serve``` works
- understand how concurrency is handled by the async/await keywords (emphasis on coroutine ("preemptive") behavior)
- write report (what actually must be included?)
    - maybe some questions about the inner workings of websockets or the questions overarching the previous item (going through the lectures about communication again would be a great option, added by investing some time in the final assignment and overall material revision for the midterm)
- start the assignment 2 (PG-2)
